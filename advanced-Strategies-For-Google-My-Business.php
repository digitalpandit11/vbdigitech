Hence are constantly working on optimizing their website and Google ads, But what they don’t know is that there’s third element arrived called Google my business, which needs optimization too!</p>

                        <p>Let’s point out some key benefits of Google My business and Some Strategies to upgrade your listing & Using GMB as a SEO tool.</p>       

                        
                        
                         <h2 style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Long Review From Real Customers</h2>

                          <div class="post-media post-image image-angle">
                             <img  src="images/blog/customer_review.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                          </div>

                         
                          
                          <p>Encourage your customers to write a long review. When they add their reviews with photos, it makes your feed more seo friendly, as this review may contain many keywords as your customer gonna elaborate its experience with your service in very wide manner.</p>
                          <p>When I’m talking about real customer, it’s not because Ethical and Honesty is a best Policy ; obviously it is, But when customer reviews your product (in detail) he/she must be using unprofessional words and mentions only product that they bought from you.</p>
                          <p>GMB (Google my business) listings contains review snippets. Which not only let your business shown on maps but also analyses keywords that are mentioned in reviews and rank businesses accordingly. This strategy will force google to associate with your content and feature your business on numbers of keywords.</p>


                          <h2 style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">In Action Photos</h2>

                         
                          <p>You must use active photos of your business both on social media and google my business, Such as your working staff, you interacting with your own clients (with permission). For Example you are running a restaurant in pune. Then just don’t post photos of kitchen & restaurant board or a menu.</p>
                          <p>Shortly don’t use instrumental pictures as we fill more safe with humans only. Action photos builts trust with your visitors and also get them message that you are active.</p>
                          <p>So don’t use boring photos, instead post real and high quality images.</p>


                          <h2 style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Website Content</h2>

                          <div class="post-media post-image image-angle">
                             <img  src="images/blog/website-content.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                          </div>

                         
                          
                          <p>Website will be the engine of your business if we assume google my business as a car. It’s all depends on your website to get your visitors converted. </p>
                          <p>And Petrol/diesel of this car will be website content. Most of the business websites don’t work on their content. Their homepages are decorated by slides or has an average generic content (Like telling themselves as best service provider in area).</p>
                          <p>Instead of using average content on website. Mention your USPs (Unique selling points) on your homepage and arrange it professionally.</p>


                          <h2 style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Strong CTA</h2>

                          <div class="post-media post-image image-angle">
                             <img  src="images/blog/cta.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                          </div>

                          
                          <p>If website is engine and content is petrol. Then CTA must be the steering wheel of this car (google my business).</p>
                          <p>CTA stand for call to action. This is an element of your website content that encourages people to take action. Viewers don’t knows what they have to do after seeing your business. So the words like learn more, buy, subscribe are come into play and are called CTA words/buttons.</p>
                          <p>Simply you need to add relevant, attractive and noticeable CTA Button in your website content. Tell your visitors that what to do next after reaching website ; to fill contact form, call or visit your store.</p>


                          <h2 style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Focus On Other Plateforms Too</h2>

                          
                          <p>Why bing/ other platforms? This question might arrived in your mind, if you are getting all your business from google/GMB. But point to be noted that google also counts other platforms as a citation source including justdial, bing, mapmyindia and indiamart.</p>
                          <p>Hence, you must list your business on various platforms. Basically don’t let go any platform even if they don’t get you customers but can increase citation.</p>

                          <h2 style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Get A Good Agency</h2>

                          
                          <p>If you are really serious about your business and want to grow it professionally, then you must hire a good seo agency.</p>
                          <p>Keep in mind that you can’t do all the things yourself . If you tried to so, then it’s not that much productive as it have to be. But you must need a seo knowledge to hire a good agency.</p>
                          <p>Looks at it as an investment not a spending because, when dedicated agency works for you, it approaches more clients, help increasing brand awareness and thus to increase business credibility.</p>
