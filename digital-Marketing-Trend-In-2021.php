                     <div class="entry-content">
                        <p>Digital Marketing tactics that works have always been changed over the years, but honestly change that we have seen past year are much more dramatic than anyone seen before and it makes sense because 2020 was year full of curveballs and we had no chance but to adapt it.</p>
                        <p>So, in this discussion below we are going to reveal some newest trend that gaining popularity this year. Let’s dive in.</p>       

                        
                        
                         <h2 style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Live Videos</h2>

                          <div class="post-media post-image image-angle">
                             <img  src="images/blog/IMG-20210422-WA0007.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                          </div>

                         
                          
                          <p>This is nowhere as surprising to say “video is the future” and it’s not going to be any different in 2021. In fact in light of recent events, it’s gonna grow even faster than previously predicted.</p>
                          <p>Even if you have never consider yourself as a video person, then 2020 probably turned you into one, whether you know it or not. In Fact live video blue up in 2020 by 99% to be exact. Thanks to the global pandemic, mandated stay at home orders, and social distancing regulations, people across the globe turned to video to stay connected.</p>
                          <p>Hopping on Zoom calls become the new thing to say. We zoomed for work, for happy hours, for holidays and almost everything. And thus the general population became more comfortable with the video. Other forms of video communication also started becoming part of the norms such as tik-tok (no more), instagram reels, Facebook lives and even twitter, YouTube and LinkedIn have options of streaming live video now. </p>


                          <h2 style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Audio Content</h2>

                          <div class="post-media post-image image-angle">
                             <img  src="images/blog/IMG-20210422-WA0005.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                          </div>
                         
                          <p>If you are not a video person, you will be happy to know that audio content is on the rise, But did you know that more than 100 million Americans consumes at least one podcast each month. Even audio content is rising at new level in India, thanks to applications like audible. </p>
                          <p>According to survey 43% of the Indian Consuming Long audio content like podcasts, interviews and motivational talks. YouTube gets it and now planning for audible ads on their platform, even twitter now allows users for audio tweets.</p>
                          <p>So whether you’re frequent podcast listener or audio massage sender one thing is certain audio content cannot be ignored in 2021.</p>


                          <h2 style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">User Generated Content</h2>

                          <div class="post-media post-image image-angle">
                             <img  src="images/blog/IMG-20210422-WA0020.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                          </div>

                         
                          
                          <p>Now, this is not anything new but just like live streaming in 2020, User Generated Content marketing generally skyrocketed. More businesses are turning to social media to promote their product than ever before, But not in typical paid ads.</p>
                          <p>User-generated content includes those videos, images or reviews that you see your favorite brand reposting all of the time. They are candid, real and they are supper relatable. According to tintup.com 86% of the companies today use user- generated content marketing strategies at very first priority.</p>
                          <p>Sometimes, it’s actually celebrity (influencer) who has paid partnership with that brand, and other times, its genuine feedback from a fan of the brand and it is totally brilliant because it works. User-generated content is basically the best word-of-mouth marketing strategy you could ever implement. It all comes down to the core fact that people trusts other people, but we don’t always trust the brand itself (at least not at first). We all expect the brand to self-promote and talk about how great and superior they are. But when someone promotes them we’re all ears and we’re way more likely to buy.</p>


                          <h2 style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Brand Activism</h2>

                          <div class="post-media post-image image-angle">
                             <img  src="images/blog/IMG-20210422-WA0006.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                          </div>

                          
                          <p>With the much-needed rise of political, social, and environmental activism, that the world saw last year it’s not really surprising to see brand activism pop up as an up-and-coming marketing trend.</p>
                          <p>In the day and age of the conscious consumers, brands have no choise but to step up, Speak up and take responsibility or else they risk loosing a entire generation of customers, And 2020 saw hundereds of brands speaking up and engaging in activism.</p>


                          <h2 style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Branded Content </h2>

                          <div class="post-media post-image image-angle">
                             <img  src="images/blog/IMG-20210422-WA0016.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                          </div>
                          
                          <p>Another Digital marketing trend that has been on the rise is branded content. Now, ths goes back to the very core marketing rinciple that people don’t wanna feel like that they are being sold something. They want value, want entertenmet and they want an experience. And that is actually what well-done branded content does, it delivers an enjoyable experience for the customer without force-feeding an ad down their throat. In fact branded content tends to engage more than displayed ads like banner ads which is to be honest, we typically just scroll right past because it has been become white noise in the cyber sphere.</p>
                          <p>Times have Changed and that type of in-your-face marketing just doesn’t really work anymore. Branding content works because it engages the audience with entertainment value, educational value, or inspirational value.</p>
                          <p>The best branded content out there is sometime is  so subtle that you don’t even realize it’s branded content at all. Like, think of a movie you watch these days, very smoothly introduces you a coffee, burger or perfumes.</p>
