                     <div class="entry-content">
                        <p class="jt">The E-commerce industry is booming in this harsh situation of covid. And this can be the right time for businesses to have their E-commerce website, if you are looking to dive into this world of infinity profits.</p>
                          
                        <p class="jt">It makes sense to have an e-commerce website these days. After all, it offers great flexibility, diversity and affordability for customers.</p>
                        <p class="jt">So, how you are going to start e-commerce business? This is completely beginners guide to help to get that.</p>


                          <h2 style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">STEP-1 RESEARCH YOUR E-COMMERCE NICHE </h2>

                          <div class="post-media post-image image-angle">
                             <img  src="images/blog/ecommerce_business1.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                          </div>
                         
                          <p class="jt">Research should be the very first step in learning and deciding your E-commerce business niche. Initially, you have to consider what exactly your business will be offering to customers? What will you be selling a product or services? Will it be physical or digital?   What will be your presentation strategies? And etc.</p>
                          <p class="jt">This questions will help you understanding your business niche and creating your own strategies. This process is going to help you assessing specific target points of your business and plans to reach them.</p>
                          <p class="jt">Along with great profits, E-commerce business brings you an immense quantity of competition (as even your local competitor is having online presence). But, instead of being worried about it you have to find some space in this competition world where you can establish your e-commerce business and success in selling products and services.</p>


                          <h2 style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">STEP-2 CHOOSE YOUR BUSINESS NAME AND LEGAL STRUCTURE</h2>

                          <!-- <div class="post-media post-image image-angle">
                             <img  src="images/blog/doman2.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                          </div>
 -->
                         
                          
                          <p class="jt"> “What’s in a name”- this phrase has expired in this digital world as nothing can be profitable without a name (Especially businesses).</p>
                          <p class="jt">So, once you’ve decided plan for your business, the next step is to get your business named. Your business could work as a face of your business in E-commerce niche (Along with logo).</p>
                          <p class="jt">But, keep in mind that everyone now wants a clarity about your products and services, and your brand name should tell them about your business. You also have check if business name is available for you- means make sure that you are not using business name which is already being claimed. You can check this information in trademark’s physical office or online website in India.</p>
                          <p class="jt">Like a trademark, domain is a unique identity in field of internet. So, you need to make sure that your business name domain should be available to you. You can sort this problem by changing format of your domain. For Example, businessname.com isn’t available for you then you can apply to businessname.co (/.in/.us/.org etc.) or nichenamebusinessname.com. But, ideally you should use a short, easily memorable and ethical domain name for your business.</p>


                          <h2 style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">STEP-3 LEGALIZE YOUR BUSINESS </h2>

                          <div class="post-media post-image image-angle">
                             <img  src="images/blog/ecommerce_business2.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                          </div>

                          
                          <p class="jt">Registering your company with all legal formalities is one of the most crucial steps in starting e-commerce/ traditional business.</p>
                          <p class="jt">DIN (director’s identification number) is a unique business ID to start your business in India (be it online or offline).</p>
                          <p class="jt">There are many such documents which you must have in order to apply for DIN or any other government certification like, PAN Card, Andhra card, Bank account etc. then you have to submit these documents in ROC (Registrar of company) of India.</p>
                          <p class="jt">After receiving conformation of a business name, your company is now allowed to incorporate within six months. Then you should apply for GST Certification, provident fund and finally for certification of companies incorporation and thus your company will be officially registered.</p>


                          <h2 style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">STEP-4 BUILD YOUR E-COMMERCE WEBSITE </h2>
                          <div class="post-media post-image image-angle">
                             <img  src="images/blog/need_website.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                          </div>
                          
                          <p class="jt">Building your E-commerce website should be as same as building a physical store or an industry. Every element of website such as logo, design, art and font should be well researched and must sink with your business idea. It’s better to hire someone expert in designing and developing your website like VB Deglitch, We are renowned web development and digital marketing agency situated in Pune, and happily serving national and international clients.</p>
                          <p class="jt">You can design your website in two ways, either by pre-built or custom ones. If you are hiring experts then no need to explore these topics but, you must have idea about what fits your website most.</p>

                          <h2 style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">STEP-5 HIRE A SEO EXPERT</h2>
                          <div class="post-media post-image image-angle">
                             <img  src="images/blog/ecommerce_business3.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                          </div>
                          
                          <p class="jt">Having a website without SEO optimization, is like a having a physical store at market place but always shut-down. If your customers or visitors don’t know you exists online then you will be ending with bulk of debt over head. SEO (search engine optimization) helps you reach more and more potential customers and cost a penny as compared to traditional forms marketing or showcasing your product.</p>
