                        <p>Hey everyone…</p>
                          
                        <p>There&#39;s a brand new Google algorithm update that you need to know about, because your SEO rankings may increase or decrease depending on where you stand with it. According to Google they will begin using page experience as part of their ranking systems, beginning in mid-June of 2021.</p>
                        <p>We will uncover what exactly this means. So, your website is not penalized and loses rankings instead. Hopefully you&#39;ll be able to use this update to move up the rankings past your competitors.</p>


                          <h2 style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">What It Is?</h2>
                          <p>According to backlinko, there are almost 200 ranking factors to rank your page at the top of the list. There has historically been things like getting quality backlinks and properly optimizing the architecture of your website for the keywords you wish to rank for. Those are the signals that Google uses in order to help people find the best information available, Which is Google’s main goal and those things are still important but now they have found a new way to determine “how helpful a web page is to their users page experience” since Google’s main goal is to offer the best experience to his users then it only makes sense to look at the actual page experience of the websites. It chooses to rank and now that&#39;s about to happen so let&#39;s talk about it.</p>


                          <h2 style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">What Is Page Experience?</h2>

                          <!-- <div class="post-media post-image image-angle">
                             <img  src="images/blog/doman2.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                          </div>
 -->
                         
                          
                          <p>Page experience signals are signals that measure how users perceive the experience of interacting with a certain web page. Basically Google wants to prioritize pages that offer the best experience to his users. According to Google not only do they want to prioritize these pages in the search results but they also want to highlight these experiences to help searchers understand what type of experience they can expect. There may be some visual indicator on the search results that help users understand if a website has met Google’s criteria. While it&#39;s not so clear how exactly this will look on the search results quite yet what is clear is that the update will impact virtually every website on their platform.</p>


                          <h2 style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">What you need to know to stay relevant in Google search results?</h2>

                          <p>Here’s how you can optimize your page experience. The very first thing I’d suggest is for you to sign up for Google search console. Google search console is free to use and has a page experience report from Google that will tell you if your web pages have a good page experience or not according to Google. A good page experience is a Url that has good core web vitals, no mobile issues and is secure. Things that can impact your core web vitals are things like page speeds if it takes too long for people to load your website content then this obviously is not a good page experience and things that can impact your mobile experience could be a number of things like elements being too close together the content being way too wide or the text being so small that people cannot even read it on a mobile device these are all things you can find out about your website by using the Google search console you can use the reports to identify specific opportunities to help you improve the page experience of your website.</p>

                          <p>Although this update has not officially rolled out yet, there is already a positive correlation between top websites and results from SEO just check these case studies out Vodafone improved their page experience and saw an eight percent increase in sales. Yahoo decreased the number of urls with poor performance in the search console and saw a 15 percent jump in page views and yelp saw a 15 improvement in their conversion rate after fixing technical issues with how their content loaded on their website and the list goes on and on from here the top websites are already working on their user experience not only because it helps with SEO but it ultimately helps them generate more customers.</p>


                          <h2 style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">How Page Experience Will Help Your SEO</h2>
                          
                          <p>Improving the experience of your website helps you show up on Google while simultaneously helping you delight the people who visit your website and are checking out what you have to offer with all of that said. You might be wondering how important is page experience in comparison to the hundreds of other ranking signals, well here&#39;s what Google had to say about this the page experience update: “introduces a new signal that our search algorithms will use alongside hundreds of other signals”.</p>

                          <h2 style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Conclusion</h2>
                          
                          <p>To determine the best content to show in response to a query our systems will continue to prioritize pages with the best information overall even if some aspects of page experience are subpar and a good page experience doesn&#39;t override having great relevant content two big things here number one the pages with the best information overall will always have priority.</p>

                          <p>This re-emphasizes that content is ultimately keying in the algorithm if you have the best page experience with poor information you will likely still not outperform your competitors. The second biggest thing is that the page experience is just one signal out of hundreds of other signals that Google looks at so this single update likely won&#39;t make or break your SEO standings alone. However, if all else is equal with you in the site that is ranking above you then I’d assume that the website with a better page experience will prevail over your website with that said I’d suggest taking a good look at your website&#39;s page experience now in the Google search console so you don&#39;t fall victim to this update.</p>
