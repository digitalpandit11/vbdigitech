                        <p class="jt">SEO (Search engine optimization) is one of the best ways to get found online, because you are basically putting yourself in front of your target customers at the exact moment they’re searching for what you offer. </p>
                        <div class="post-media post-image image-angle">
                           <img  src="images/blog/IMG-20210422-WA0012.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                        </div>      
                          
                          <p class="jt">The thing is every business wants to be on the first page for search terms but what people don’t realize is that only first five spots really ever get any real attention so the problem becomes how does a small business competes for those slots, And SEO becomes answer for your business. It helps you earn organic customers, but it takes a lot of time to get there or money that you pay to hire an SEO expert to help get you there.</p>

                          <h2 style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Mobile Friendlyness</h2>

                          <div class="post-media post-image image-angle">
                             <img  src="images/blog/IMG-20210422-WA0009.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                          </div>
                         
                          <p class="jt">I don't know if you know but more than half of internet searches right now take place on mobile devices. Google has actually been penalizing any site that doesn't really load optimally on mobile and desktop too. You can easily test your site any mobile-friendliness checker tool. These tools measures load time of your website. And that’s really valuable because it really takes out the guesswork and you and your developer actually knows what it is you need to work on.</p>
                          <p class="jt">Most of the peoples are going to leave your webpage, if it doesn’t loads within 3 seconds. So you definitely want to make sure that it loads within that time because Google knows exactly how long your page typically takes to load and it's not even going to show your listing if it knows that you have a really slow site.</p>


                          <h2 style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Directory Listing</h2>

                          <div class="post-media post-image image-angle">
                             <img  src="images/blog/IMG-20210422-WA0004.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                          </div>

                         
                          
                          <p class="jt">Get your website listed in all relevant local and business specific directories, so every local area whatever city you live in it's going to have specific business directories associated with it. Same for your business category lawyers have their own doctors have their own so basically you're going to want to find all those opportunities for being listed in these directories and make sure you're listed in all of them.</p>
                          <p class="jt">This helps for SEO because it helps Google see that you're there and that you're a real business. Another major benefit of these directories is that, for each one you get listed in almost all of them are going to provide you with a backlink or a link to your site and generally these are pretty reputable backlinks, because they're from reputable directory websites.</p>
                          <p class="jt">Links are still a huge ranking factor in the eyes of Google, so basically think of a link to your site as a vote for your website so simply put Google basically tallies all the votes or the links taking into account the number of them. Overall quality of the websites that are linking to you and directories are a great source for small businesses to get links from they're free and it's usually just as easy as filling out the profile. Getting listed in these directories will also actually help you rank higher in the map section otherwise known as local SEO so you can easily find these directory opportunities that'll work best for your area.</p>


                          <h2 style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Optimize Your Social Media</h2>

                          <div class="post-media post-image image-angle">
                             <img  src="images/blog/IMG-20210422-WA0013.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                          </div>

                          
                          <p class="jt">once you've gotten listed in all the proper directories next you're gonna want to make sure that you've claimed and optimized all your social and review profiles so basically Google loves brands and the more of these kinds of websites review sites social sites that you're listed on the more Google is going to start seeing you as a brand so make sure you've claimed all of the proper social profiles like Facebook YouTube LinkedIn Google my business.</p>
                          <p class="jt">Also claim your listing on any relevant review sites. There's probably at least one review site for your specific niche so lawyers have AVO, plastic surgeons have real self. so if there's a specific review site for your industry make sure you're listed and make sure your profiles, filled out as completely as possible complete with photos.</p>


                          <h2 style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Competitor Research</h2>
                          
                          <p class="jt">Research your competitors. Why to reinvent the wheel when you can very easily basically spy on where your competition is already doing. Specifically I want you to check out what keywords that are currently ranking for and then what are they doing to get those high rankings so basically you can see what links they're getting from other sites as well as what content they have on their own pages, so that you can basically then just take that in and one up what they're already doing to land on top of them.</p>
                          <p class="jt">How do you get this information? Well, there are lots of online tools that can really do this research for you the only problem is they usually come with a pretty hefty monthly subscription price. What I gonna recommend you is that, rather than doing this yourself hire someone who specializes in this kind of research.</p>
                          <p class="jt">We, VB Digitech are best digital marketing services provider in Pune. With our premium SEO services we will help you getting full-portfolio of your competitors and optimize you’re landing pages accordingly.</p>

                          <h2 style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Optimize Your Search Listing</h2>

                          <div class="post-media post-image image-angle">
                             <img  src="images/blog/IMG-20210422-WA0023.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                          </div>

                          
                          <p class="jt">One of the major factors that Google now looks at is how likely your listing to be clicked in the search is. There are a few things you can do to really make your listing more appealing and more click worthy. For every listing there's basically two different elements you want to focus on they’re the title and the Meta Description.</p>
                          <p class="jt">Let’s focus on the title first: the first thing you want accomplished in the title is you do want to use the keyword phrase that you want to rank for. Make sure that it looks as relevant as possible to the searchers but you don't want to stop there and you don't want to waste your title by just using your city or your business name alone.</p>
                          <p class="jt">For example, if you’re wanting to optimize your page surrounding Electrical appliances in Pune (keyword), then you must use power words such as Best, free, offer etc.</p>
                          <p class="jt">Meta Description or the short blurb that appears under the title this really should be a short supporting statement that give searchers or reason to click-through and that means talking to your customer with a benefit they actually care about.</p>
                          <p class="jt">Now is the time where I want to hear from you, if you're using any of these tactics or if you're using any other tactics to get found in SEO? If so please leave them in the comments below.</p>
